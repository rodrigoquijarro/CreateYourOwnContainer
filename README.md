# CreateYourOwnContainer
## Create child process
- To create a child process we have to create a child function with its own pid such that the child thinks that there is no other process runing.We do that by calling the clone() function with the CLONE_NEWPID flag.We can also use a different system call called unshare to do similar task.Once we call clone(), is called with the flag added, the new process starts within a new PID namespace, under a new process tree.
- We can add many flags to the clone() function depending on what we want to be isolated from the containter point of view.

```int clone_flags = CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWPID|CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWNET|SIGCHLD;
```

## Isolate it using namespaces
- This new process is isolated using the CLONE_NEWPID flag.this helps the process to see only this pid.

- A process which is isolated from the other process will have its own pid to be 1.

- Note that clone() is a system call and need root priviledge to execute the binary after compiling using the following command:

gcc -o pid -w pid.c

Then we can run the binary with sudo priviledge.


- I supplied flags for this PoC, the flag CLONE_NEWUTC is for container hostname, where when clone() is called it allow the container have its own hostname as in the snippet below.I also added some C code to give the container a custom name.
```
 // sethostname
        const char * new_hostname = "my container";
        if (sethostname(new_hostname, strlen(new_hostname)) != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "failed to execvp argments %s\n",
                        strerror(errno));
                exit(-1);
        }
```


- Meanwhile on the other hand the flag CLONE_NEWUSER enable the container to handle its own user and group.In this case since we did not create one , it will have nobody as user as seen below. 

- For Networking , I used the flag CLONE_NEWNET, which allow the container to look only it's own network interface. It is usually loopback if there are no other explicitely set up network interface.

- Below we can see the network interface for the child process with respect to that of the main host. 

- But for us to make the two processes , parent and child process each manage thier network interfaces, we need to create a pair of virtual Ethernet connections using the following command:

ip link add name veth0 type veth peer name veth1 netns <pid>

- Where <pid is the process id of the child namespace, veth0 device is for the parent namespace and veth1 device for the child namespace device.We enter new namespace using the netns.

For example for the pid 4 found in /proc , when I use the command, it created and shows that it exist since I want to do it again.  

- For mount point, we need to use the flag CLONE_NEWNS and precise a mounting point.This mounting point have been handled using C via the following code snippet.


        // mount proc
        if (umount("/proc", 0) != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "failed unmount /proc %s\n",
                        strerror(errno));
                exit(-1);
        }
        if (mount("proc", "/proc", "proc", 0, "") != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "failed mount /proc %s\n",
                        strerror(errno));
                exit(-1);
        }

- The easiest way to mount proc can simply be using the command :
mount proc /proc -t proc
- In some cases, chroot() can also be used as well.
- We need to create a virtual disk using the loop tool.This will host the file system of our containter.
- We use the following commands:
- Using dd command I create 10G of zerod file.i.e full with zeros.

dd if=/dev/zero of=files.fs bs=1024 count=10000000

- Then I used the command losetup -f to tell me which /dev/loop is free.
- Next, losetup /dev/loop1 file.fs
- We use the ext4 file system via the command below using the tool mkfs :

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/loop1 

- We mount to the mnt directory using the command :

mkdir mnt
mount -t ext4 /dev/loop1 /mnt

- We verify using the mount | grep mnt 

- We can see that there is a new file created and all works. 

## Benchmark [ Your container, host machine, LXC, Docker ]

- I benchmarked on cpu, memory, fileio, threading using the following commands respectively:

sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=2000000 --num-threads=120 run

sysbench --test=memory --num-threads=140 --memory-total-size=10G run

sysbench --num-threads=16 --test=fileio --file-total-size=10G 
--file-test-mode=rndrw prepare

sysbench --test=threads --thread-locks=10 --max-time=60 run

sysbench --num-threads=16 --test=fileio --file-total-size=10G --file-test-mode=rndrw cleanup 

- See benchmark report document for details of the benchmark.

- Also for testing process, especially for conatiner, we need to place the different benchmark commands in the system function system("Benchmark commands here"), and run.The different commands can be found in the document report. or the one provided above.
